## Idea
My current Idea is to program a simple version of UNO, with a simple user interface. It should support
playing against bots, how many depending on what your choice is. There is also going to be a bot only mode,
that will only let bots play. This is mostly there to ensure a good working on the bots, and just as a fun
little feature. As a little added bonus feature it should also support having a commandline only version,
to even support those command line freaks. (this does include me)

## Implementation
The core should be able to use different interfaces for graphics. This makes the above-mentioned command 
line mode easier to implement. Such a feature should also open up the possibility for other developers
to implement their own style into the game. Maybe even a more complex one than what the base version 
comes with. The core should also follow the [Official Uno Rules](https://www.unorules.com/). 

## Updates on the docs
The docs will be recently updated with the newest Ideas and features
